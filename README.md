## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am an **ambitious and passionate engineer** who loves solving complex challenges and pushing my limits.  
Sports have played a big role in shaping my resilience and discipline – I was a **professional rower for the Portuguese national team** for 5 years (2018 - 2022).  

My academic journey started with a **Bachelor's in Economics** (finished in 2023), but my curiosity for technology led me to pursue **Informatics and Computing Engineering**, where I completed 2 full years (plus 2 additional subjects) – enough to be accepted into the **Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering** at FEUP.  

- 🎓 **Bachelor's GPA:** 18.4 / 20 (Top 2% of students)  
- 🎓 **Current Master's GPA:** 18.3 / 20 – aiming for **19 / 20** (Top 2% of students) upon graduation (expected 2026)
